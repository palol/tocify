# Quartz dashboard scaffold (Plotly articles graph)

Copy these files into your **Quartz vault** so the articles dashboard page shows an interactive Plotly graph.

## Setup

1. Run `tocify dashboard` so that `content/articles-dashboard.md` and `public/articles.json` exist in your vault.

2. Copy the component into your vault's Quartz tree:
   - Copy `ArticlesGraph.tsx` to `quartz/components/ArticlesGraph.tsx`.
   - If your Quartz already has `quartz/components/types.ts`, remove or change the import in `ArticlesGraph.tsx` to use that types file (e.g. keep `import type { ... } from "./types"` if types live in the same folder).

3. Register the component in `quartz/components/index.ts`:
   ```ts
   import ArticlesGraph from "./ArticlesGraph"
   export { ..., ArticlesGraph }
   ```

4. Add the component to your content page layout in `quartz.layout.ts`, for example in the `pageBody` or `afterBody` section so it appears below the main content:
   ```ts
   pageBody: [... existing ..., ArticlesGraph()],
   ```

5. Build Quartz (`npx quartz build`). Open the articles-dashboard page; the graph loads `/articles.json` and renders with Plotly.js (loaded from CDN).

## Notes

- The component only renders when the current page slug is `articles-dashboard` (the default slug for `content/articles-dashboard.md`).
- Ensure `public/articles.json` is present (generated by `tocify dashboard`). Quartz serves files from `public/` at the site root, so the graph fetches `/articles.json`.
