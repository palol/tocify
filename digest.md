<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>While visual working memory (WM) is strongly associated with reductions in occipitoparietal alpha (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) power, the role of frontal midline theta (4&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz) power is less clear, with both increases and decreases widely reported. Here, we test the hypothesis that this theta paradox can be explained by nonoscillatory, aperiodic neural activity dynamics. Because traditional time&ndash;frequency analyses of electroencephalography (EEG) data conflate oscillations and aperiod…
