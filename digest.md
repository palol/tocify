<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Early detection of dementia enables timely intervention and better care planning. Electroencephalography, being accessible and noninvasive, offers a practical avenue for monitoring pathological alterations in neural activity. Classical biomarkers like the theta-to-alpha power ratio TAR along with complexity measures, are common methods that are usually evaluated and used for dementia detection. In this study, we aimed to assess the discriminative ability of a novel entropy-based family of measur…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>Allodynia (perceiving touch as painful) is an enduring symptom of neuropathic pain. While acute pain is initiated by afferent signaling from the periphery to spinal cord, pain chronification recruits ongoing activity in supraspinal sites. One such site that has been proposed to be important in pain chronification is the caudal granular insular cortex (CGIC). The present studies of allodynia in response to sciatic nerve injury in male and female rats focus on the role of CGIC in pain chronific…
